# Etch-a-Sketch

A project build by me from The Odin project, this is etch a sketch page where
you can draw by holding down mouse button and fill the grids(flex-boxes) inside


you can change the size of grids, pick color and choose a eraser

I am planning to add more features in the future

Thankyou.
